# This file describes how to create a GLASS "master" catalog.

 - A "master" catalog is (as of 20150528) a combination of all of the
   items listed on the HST MAST website and Kuang's photozs. The programs
   used to create one are:
   
   readglasslist.pro -- Converts Kasper's ASCII GLASS source
   		     	lists to a FITS binary
   readgig.pro 	     -- Converts Kasper's ASCII GiG files to FITS binary format
   readredshift.pro  -- Converts Kasper's ASCII glass GiGz files
   		        to FITS tables. **DOES NOT WORK FOR MACS1149**
   translatekuang.pro - culls Kuangs HUGE FITS tables to more useable
   		      	sizes. Inclues all 7 band photmoetry plus
			photoZs and errors.
   join2cats.pro     -- Joins 2 of the above catalogs (FITS tables), stripping
   		     	repeat tags and forcing them to the length/order
			of the GLASS source lists.
